## Tasks
- Build UI
- Style application
- Fetch data
   - Get city lat/lon from [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/)
   - Pass data to [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)
- Display output and reset form

## Challenges/Edge Cases
- How to name components properly?
- Error handling
  - City does not exist
  - Weather data can not be fetched
- Organize styles based on modules

### Solved
- Get APIs for location/weather
- Handle race conditions by using `useEffect()`
- Fetching two URLs depending on each other at the same time
- Using SCSS instead of regular CSS
- Hide output container initially

## Things I learned so far
- Inputs can have a Regex pattern like `pattern=[A-Za-z]` but it doesn't work within React ðŸ˜”
- Check if an object is empty via `Object.keys(Obj).length`
- Set focus on input on page load via `autofocus` (React: autoFocus)
- Use a boolean flag to avoid race conditions: `return () => { isFetchingData = false; }`

## Ideas
- Show city suggestions while typing
- Provide loading indicator after click
- Get position of user via browser geo
- Save/Delete search queries
- Change background color based on current temperature
- Add a favicon to the header

### Implemented
- Disable button while waiting for response

## Tech Stack
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
- React
- SASS
- Vite
